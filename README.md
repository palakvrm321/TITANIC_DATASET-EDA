Summary of Findings  
1.Gender was the strongest predictor: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.  
2.Passenger Class mattered a lot: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, 3rd class the lowest.  
3.Fare was positively correlated with survival: passengers who paid higher fares (often 1st class) were more likely to survive.  
4.Age had some impact: children (especially infants) had better chances of survival, though the effect was weaker compared to gender and class.  
5.Overall survival rate was low (38%), showing the tragedyâ€™s severity.  
6.The dataset shows clear social and economic factors influenced survival (gender, class, wealth).
